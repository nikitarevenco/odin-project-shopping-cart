# Shopping Cart

This project was made for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum as part of learning web development. I am leaving these projects up and public for anyone who would want to see my journey to becoming a software engineer. 

## What I Learned

- Learned to create a single page application by using the React Router.
- Learned to set up dynamic routes with React Router.

## Features

- The website has categories, each category has several shop items.
- Each shop item is its own page, with the ability to add to cart.
- Cart state is saved across the application.

## Running locally

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm ci` to install the dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` and head over to `localhost:5137`.
